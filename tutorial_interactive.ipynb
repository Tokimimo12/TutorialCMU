    "# Tutorial on CMU-Multimodal SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial on using ***CMU-Multimodal SDK*** to load and process multimodal time-series datasets and training a simple late-fusion LSTM model on the processed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we specify some constants in `./constans/paths.py`. Please first take a look and modify the paths to point to the correct folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We start off by (down)loading the datasets. In the SDK each dataset has three sets of content: `highlevel`, `raw` and `labels`. `highlevel` contains the extracted features for each modality (e.g OpenFace facial landmarks, openSMILE acoustic features) while `raw` contains the raw transctripts, phonemes. `labels` are self-explanatory. Note that some datasets have more than just one set of annotations so `labels` could also give you multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there's a caveat that the SDK will not automatically detect if you have downloaded the data already. In event of that it will throw a `RuntimeError`. We work around that by `try/except`. This is not ideal but it will work for now."

A dataset contains multiple computational sequences whose key is the `text_field`, `visual_field`, `acoustic_field` as defined above. Each computational sequence, however, has multiple video IDs in it, and different computational sequences are supposed to have the same set of video IDs. Within each video, there are two arrays: `features` and `intervals`, denoting the feature values at each time step and the start and end timestamp for each step. We can take a look at its content."

    "## Alignment of multimodal time series\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with multimodal time series that contains multiple views of data with different frequencies, we have to first align them to a ***pivot*** modality. The convention is to align to ***words***. Alignment groups feature vectors from other modalities into bins denoted by the timestamps of the pivot modality, and apply a certain processing function to each bin. We call this function ***collapse function***, because usually it is a pooling function that collapses multiple feature vectors from another modality into one single vector. This will give you sequences of same lengths in each modality (as the length of the pivot modality) for all videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we define our collapse funtion as simple averaging. We feed the function to the SDK when we invoke `align` method. Note that the SDK always expect collapse functions with two arguments: `intervals` and `features`. Even if you don't use intervals (as is in the case below) you still need to define your function in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note: Currently the SDK applies the collapse function to all modalities including the pivot, and obviously text modality cannot be \"averaged\", causing some errors. My solution is to define the avg function such that it averages the features when it can, and return the content as is when it cannot average.***"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
